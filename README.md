Your version of Google should have a homepage, with a logo, search bar and two buttons.
Upon pressing one button an API call should be executed and users should be shown a page with ten results.
Upon pressing the other, users should be taken to the page of one of the results.
NB: You are creating your own API. It is up to you if you want to make use of the Google Search API in addition but it is not a requirement
